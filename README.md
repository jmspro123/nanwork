## Problem Statement
How can we get employers to be open and hire women who have less social mobility and may not have access to livelihood opportunities?

Women from underprivileged families are unable to get/sustain jobs because of childcare contingencies. 

They appear as unattractive candidates in the eyes of employers and are therefore disadvantaged in employment opportunities. 

While the solution may be childminding services, current existing platforms are mostly unidirectional and are lacking in direct engagement between mothers and nannies.

## The Solution
nanWork aims to create a social platform for mothers and nannies, connecting suitable nannies for mothers through a filtering process and encouraging social interaction between the two stakeholders.

nanWorkâ€™s objective is to bridge mothers with employers who have concerns about hiring women with childcare contingencies, encouraging employers to be more open to hiring mothers who have less social mobility.

## Our Hack
Automated process in pairing up our clients. The app requires little manpower to operate, yet it is efficient in reaching a large number of clients. Mothers can easily find suitable nannies, while nannies can filter from a wide pool of listings. 

**Mothers**
- able to post their day-to-day childminding needs in detail on nanWork for interested nannies to view. 

**Nannies**
- Able to view job listed by mothers and filter out the suitable listings based on age of child, time of day, start date etc. 

## Evaluation
Our solution attempts to address the concerns of both employers and mothers.

**Employers**
- More open to hiring mothers, with an ease of mind that their childcare contingencies will not be a major concern, providing more access to livelihood opportunities for these mothers.

**Mothers**
- The social element and ease of access brought by nanWork would encourage mothers to be more willing to reach out to childminders and take up employment opportunities.
